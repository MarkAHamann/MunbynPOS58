# Printer Program for Munbyn POS-58 (Windows)

The Munbyn POS-58 receipt printer is a small receipt thermal printer.

It is about $50 on amazon.com.

My usage is for printing radio communications in emergency and drill
situations. Communication can come in by radio and I can enter it
as I hear it into a program like notepad or winlink.

Then if I want to print it out, I can either:
* drag text and drop it into this program
* copy to the clipboard and right click in this program

In either case, it will print the text to the POS-58 printer.

## Future Enhancements

* Font size control (spin box/text box)
* Font control (dropdown/text box)
* Printer Picker (drodown)
* Accept file, detect format:
    - if an ICS-213 (Winlink format), print the relevant data
    - if just text, print the file
    - if ???, do ???
